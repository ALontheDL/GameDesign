Introduction
Toxic College App Simulator is the hub for all things college apps related, from a comprehensive prediction of your chances at any college given your application input (statistics, extracurriculars, awards, etc.) to a public forum and chatroom to toxically discuss away all your college stresses! Users can also simulate college rejection letters, acceptance letters, and sign-in portals for their colleges. The website caters primarily to current seniors in the process of college applications (having recently submitted their earlies) as well as other high school students gearing up for the college admissions process.

The use of this website is in the concentration of seniors' pent-up stress regarding the college application process into a single location as an outlet for general stress and emotional turmoil.

User Interaction
- Home page with a variety of buttons that can toggle to other pages: one for ChanceMe, another for Reddit-esque forums, and another for editorial suggestions or feedback on inputted applications.
- Users can input the entirety of their college application and receive an output prediction of their chances at being accepted to their top choice college.
- Users can receive specific feedback tailored to their application: editorial suggestions for their essays and improvement areas for the application overall.
- Users can simulate rejection and acceptance letters for the college of their choice, complete with fake college website portal sign-ins and account dashboards.
- Users can enter chatrooms to post and share their results, muse on their thoughts and emotions during these trying times, provide necessary information, answers, and resources that others are seeking, and generally uplift one another and discover solace, comfort, and solidarity amongst others in the same boat.

Engagement / Addictiveness
- Users can both engage with each other and engage via the prediction feature to repeatedly derive usefulness from the website.

Scalability and Expansion
- Economies of scale can be achieved with a subscription model or a in-app paywall for each successive application evaluation.
- The website can likely be scaled to become a general hub for college stress relief, crowdsourced college information, and toxic emotional outlets to validate your emotional stress and mental strain.

Accessibility and Inclusivity
- This website 100% adheres to the California non-discrimination clause and ensures inclusivity for all its users. No part of the website discriminate against any demographic. In fact, unique and diverse backgrounds can actually benefit the calculated odds of your application!
