Introduction
Toxic College App Simulator is the hub for all things college apps related, from a comprehensive prediction of your chances at any college given your application input (statistics, extracurriculars, awards, etc.) to a public forum and chatroom to toxically discuss away all your college stresses! Users can also simulate college rejection letters, acceptance letters, and sign-in portals for their colleges. The website caters primarily to current seniors in the process of college applications (having recently submitted their earlies) as well as other high school students gearing up for the college admissions process.

Toxic College App Simulator aims to be a safe haven for students navigating the college application journey, offering support, encouragement, and practical assistance while fostering a sense of community and inclusivity. It serves as an online bastion of healing to alleviate the toxic pressures and anxieties that often accompany this challenging period in a student's life.

The use of this website is in the concentration of seniors' pent-up stress regarding the college application process into a single location as an outlet for general stress and emotional turmoil. The value here is subtle: that teenage self-doubt, anxiety, and environment-induced pressures are never going to go away. The solution is to build a safe, helpful, and supportive outlet for those destructive yet inevitable emotions - an alternative to replace toxic and unregulated subreddits, arbitrary cash-grab college advice blogs and counseling articles, and the prison walls and echo chambers of one's own mind unbridled with harmful imaginative scenarios.
