Introduction
Toxic College App Simulator is the hub for all things college apps related, from a comprehensive prediction of your chances at any college given your application input (statistics, extracurriculars, awards, etc.) to a public forum and chatroom to toxically discuss away all your college stresses! Users can also simulate college rejection letters, acceptance letters, and sign-in portals for their colleges. The website caters primarily to current seniors in the process of college applications (having recently submitted their earlies) as well as other high school students gearing up for the college admissions process.

The use of this website is in the concentration of seniors' pent-up stress regarding the college application process into a single location as an outlet for general stress and emotional turmoil.
